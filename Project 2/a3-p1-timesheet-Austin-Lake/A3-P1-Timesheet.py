#Description:   Design and write a program that accepts the number of hours worked on 
#               each of five work days from the user, then displays different 
#               information calculated about those entries as output.

    Design Overview: 
    Ask user for all fives inputs,
    store inputs along with appropriate day into a dictionary,
    use the dictionary to manipulate the key - value pairs in separate caluclations.

    # Gets all five work days from user

    # Sort through keys and values in dictionary to find all days with less than 7 hours worked,
    # store the values from those keys into a list, then print list to console
